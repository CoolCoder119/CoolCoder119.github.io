### Topics Covered ->
- Spring Boot API
- Endpoints Functions
- SQLITE Processing

### Spring Boot API ->

Right now, as we have no domain available for us, <br>
it is in prototype mode, hosting on http://localhost:8080. <br>
Spring Boot API makes it extremely easy to create RESTFUL <br>
services via java. It provides simple to understand <br>
annotations and functions. <br>

#### Now we will dive in into all the code Spring provides

```java

@PostMapping(value = "/endpoint", consumes = "text;charset=UTF-8")
@GetMapping(value = "/endpoint")
@ResponseStatues(HttpStatus.OK)

```
